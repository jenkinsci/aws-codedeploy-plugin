    <p>Information about how AWS CodeDeploy handles files that already exist in a deployment target location but weren't
        part of the previous successful deployment.</p>
    <p>The <strong>fileExistsBehavior</strong> parameter takes any of the following values:</p>
    • <strong>DISALLOW</strong>: The deployment fails. This is also the default behavior if no option is specified.<br>
    • <strong>OVERWRITE</strong>: The version of the file from the application revision currently being deployed replaces the version
    already on the instance.<br>
    • <strong>RETAIN</strong>: The version of the file already on the instance is kept and used as part of the new deployment.<br>
